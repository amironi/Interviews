Instructions for the Visual Studio 2010 profiler:
=================================================
[This requires Visual Studio 2010 Premium or Ultimate editions.]

1. Create a new performance session using Analyze --> Launch Performance Wizard.

2. Choose "CPU Sampling" and configure the session to run the PrimeNumberCalculation.exe application from the Binaries folder.

3. After profiling completes, identify the function in which most of the running time is spent. Look at the source code and suggest how this function can be improved.

4. (OPTIONAL) Improve the function and run the profiling session again. Right-click the two reports in Performance Explorer and compare them to see whether you improved anything.

5. (OPTIONAL, REQUIRES WINDOWS VISTA OR HIGHER) Create another performance session using the Concurrency Profiling mode. Identify whether the application is utilizing an appropriate number of threads.
